## About Me
Hi, I am Bibhav. I recently completed my Master's degree from Auburn University, AL. I am a self-motivated, experienced engineer that enjoys writing clean code, problem-solving, data structures, and algorithm design.
## Recent Highlight -- [Featured on Military REACH Website](https://militaryreach.auburn.edu/fnbibhavfinal.jsp)
I worked as a Graduate Reaseacrh Assistant on Military REACH project at AU. Some of my accomplishments include designing the functionalities for the REACH Dictionary and incorporating Cascade, a content management tool, into the website.
## Projects
### Application Development
  1. [Drinking Water AR App](https://github.com/bzb0079/DrinkingWaterARApp)
      This is a scalable Augmented Reality (AR) application created using Android Studio, ARCore, Firebase & AWS S3 to locate 20 water stations in AU. The users can visualize the       AR feature of the app by pointing the device camera towards point of interests (POIs).   
  2. [Sun path AR App]
      This is an AR app built using JavaScript, React Native, Three.js to eliminate the need for a traditional, time-consuming method to obtain solar azimuth and altitude. It           enabled users to readily see the Sun's path with 98% accuracy.
### Machine Learning
  1. [Sentiment Analysis for Autonomous Vehicle](https://github.com/bzb0079/NaiveBayes-SVM)
      Utilized AI, including supervised machine learning techniques such as NaiveBayes and SVM in Python, as well as the Twitter API, to create a text classification model that         correctly classified thousands of tweets into sentiments with a 92 percent accuracy.
### Cloud Computing
  1. [IBM Watson Assistant & Alexa Skills](https://github.com/bzb0079/IBMWatson-Alexa)
     Implemented Amazon lambda functions and IBM Cloud functions to create Alexa Skills accessible to Alexa users.
